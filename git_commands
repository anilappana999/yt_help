Basic Git Commands
------------------
git clone url -> clone repo
git pull -> pull latest changes
git add filename -> add specific file to staging
git add . -> add all files to staging
git restore --staged <file> -> recover specific file from staging
git restore . -> recover all files from staging
git commit -m "message" -> commit changes with message
git push -> push changes in local
git stash -> stash all changes in current branch
git stash pop -> applies recent stash changes and remove stash from list
git checkout branchName -> switches to specific branch name
git log -> shows history of commits
git log -1 -> shows history of latest  commit(only one commit)
git checkout commit_id -> checkout to specific commit in history
git branch -> create branch in local without switching
git checkout -b feature/new-feature -> create new branch and checkout to it
git push -u origin <branch_name> -> push local created branch to remote repository
git branch -> show current branch name with astrik(with green color) and other branch names in red color
git fetch --prune -> delete branches in local which are deleted in remote repository(some times deleted branches in remote repository will be not updated in local then we can use this command)
git reset --hard -> remove all uncomitted changes in the repository and resets all changes to last commit
git reflog -> It reflog is a powerful command in Git that displays the reference log,
              a history of changes made to the repository's references (such as branches, HEAD, and tags). 
              It allows you to see a timeline of actions (e.g., commits, rebases, resets, checkouts) that have affected the state of your repository
Deleting branch in local and pushing to remote repository
---------------------------------------------------------
Step1:
Delete the Branch Locally
Switch to a different branch (not the one you want to delete):
git checkout main
Step2:
Delete the local branch:
git branch -d branch_name
Step3:
Push the branch deleted to the remote:
git push origin --delete branch_name
-----------------------------------------------------

Create a repository in local and push it to remote repository
-------------------------------------------------------------
 Create a New Local Repository
Create a directory for your project:
mkdir my-new-repo
cd my-new-repo
Initialize a Git repository:
git init
Add required files to the repository:
echo "# My New Repo" >> README.md
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Create a Remote Repository
Go to your Git hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
Create a new repository:
Set the repository name (e.g., my-new-repo).
Leave it empty (do not initialize with a README or .gitignore if you've already created these locally).
Link the Local Repository to the Remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-new-repo.git
Replace the URL with the one for your remote repository.
Push your local repository to the remote:
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
The -M main command renames your default branch to main (if it isn't already).
The -u flag sets the upstream branch for future git push or git pull commands.


Creating branch in local and pushing it to remote repository
------------------------------------------------------------
Switch to the base branch (e.g., main or master) from which you want to create the new branch:
git checkout main
Create and switch to the new branch:
git checkout -b branch_name
(Make Changes (Optional) 
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message here")
git push -u origin branch_name
----------------------------------

GIT REBASE STEPS
----------------
we can follow rebase in two ways:
Scenario1: Let's Assume we have branch develop which created from branch master , i want to commit code changes in develop and want to
            create PR but some x person made some commits in master branch in same file i was working, so it may create conflicts while cre
            -ating PR if i dont have those changes in local, so i need to rebase develop branch against master branch and then need to commit
            code
Make sure you are on same branch you want to make changes in my case its develop branch
git stash(stash your changes first)
git rebase branchname (parent branch which you want to rebase )
git stash pop
(after resolving conflicts we can stage , commit and push changes as usual)
git add .
git commit -m "dummy-message"
git push

note : git pull --rebase --autostash (this command pull remote changes and rebase your code and also stash staged and unstaged files while rebasing code)

Scenario2: I have created branch develop from master 10 days back and im not taking rebase while committing new changes and i have made 10 
           commits and lets assume some one already changes on master branch on same files im working on ,now if i create pr it will create 
           conflicts so we need to follow some steps to rebase your child branch before creating PR

git pull --rebase
git checkout feature branch_name(if you are not on child branch)
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/master_branch_name
resolve if conflicts occur and add them to staging
git add conflicts_resolved_files
git rebase --continue
if need to abort rebase in middle execute below command
git rebase --abort
git push origin feature_brach_name --force (use it for your own branches not for public branches)
Caution When Using --force
Data Loss Risk: Any changes or commits present on the remote branch but missing in your local branch will be lost.
Impact on Team Members: If others are working on the same branch, their work might be affected, and they could face conflicts or lose their commits.
Alternative and safer command for above command is:
git push origin feature_branch_name --force-with-lease
This ensures you only force push if no one else has pushed new changes to the remote branch since your last pull or fetch.
If the remote branch has been updated by someone else, the push will fail, preventing accidental overwrites.
----------------------------------------------------
Reverting changes in git: reverting changes in git can be done in multiple ways
Undo Unstaged Changes
---------------------
To discard single file
git restore <file>
To discard multiple files
git restore .

Undo Staged Changes
-------------------
If you've already staged changes but not committed them:
For staged single file
git restore --staged <file>
For all files:
git restore --staged .

Reverting Commits
-----------------
There are different scenarios in reverting commits 

Reverting commit where changes committed in local
--------------------------------------------------
lets assume a scenario we made a commit in local now i want to revert those changes

Reverting Single commit
-----------------------
syntax git revert commit_id

Example: git revert 8364953c0c951e40171938104890e36d290d69ed

Reverting range of commits
--------------------------
git revert <oldest-commit-id>..<newest-commit-id>
git revert 314ad1c950dd0d8eab428e234e0b479d4bf19e9e.. 4732a2b820fab75c96d186836ca7d4d3b5db4c69

Revert last two or commits
--------------------------

git revert HEAD~2..HEAD (revert last 2 commits)

if i want to revert last 4 commits then i need to say HEAD~4..HEAD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In above scenarios we unserstood reverting bakc changes for local changes lets unserstand how to revert pushed changes now

lets assume i made some code changes , committed and pushed them to remote repository
now i want to revert those changes back
get commitid by executing command git log
git revert commit_id
git push
Tada.. your changes are reverted

note  we may confront of conflicts while making reverts , we need to resolve them carefully
-----
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git cherry-pick
---------------
git cherry-pick command is not limited to adding commits from another branch. It is primarily used to apply changes introduced by one or more existing commits from any source (e.g., another branch, a detached HEAD state, or even a stash commit) into the current branch.

Here are key scenarios where git cherry-pick can be used:

Applying commits from another branch:
This is the most common use case, where you pick specific commits from another branch and apply them to your current branch.


git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
Applying commits from the same branch:
You can use git cherry-pick to reapply a commit from an earlier part of the current branch to a later point.

Applying commits from a detached HEAD:
If you're working in a detached HEAD state, you can cherry-pick a commit from this state onto a branch.

Applying commits from a stash:
If you've stashed changes and created a commit for the stash (e.g., using git stash show -p), you can cherry-pick that stash commit.

Cherry-picking multiple commits:
You can cherry-pick a range of commits, either sequentially or non-sequentially.

Sequentially:
git cherry-pick <start-commit>..<end-commit>

Non-sequentially:
git cherry-pick <commit-hash-1> <commit-hash-2>


Important Notes:
Conflict Resolution: If there are conflicts during cherry-picking, Git will pause the operation and allow you to resolve them before continuing.
Commit History: Cherry-picking creates new commits with the same changes as the original commits but with different hashes, so the commits are not identical to the originals.
